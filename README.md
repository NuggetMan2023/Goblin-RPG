#Goblin-RPG

Read this before playing/editing!

My first real "game", you and the goblin take turns attacking each other and you can use 4 different abilities to help you defeat him!

Important notes:
- Whenever the player flees, it is an automatic death because that is cowardly.
- The player will always have the chance to attack or use an ability first before the goblin attacks
- I decided that when the player uses an ability, that counts as a turn. This would make it a little more difficult (if the goblin did more damage) to manage when to use certain abilities or to attack instead.
- There are only 2 classes, they do not need to be in the same package for the program to run!
